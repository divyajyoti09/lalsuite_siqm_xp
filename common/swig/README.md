# LALSuite SWIG Bindings

The LALSuite C libraries are wrapped using [SWIG](http://swig.org/)
to provide Octave and Python bindings for each library.

The wrappings are built as follows:

1. A boilerplate pre-processed interface file `swig<package>.i_preproc.i` is
   generated that `%include`s all of the package header (`.h`) files.

2. An XML representation of the library is generated by running
   `swig -xml swig<package>.i_preproc.i`.

3. The XML representation is passed to `generate_swig_iface.py` to generate
   the actual SWIG interface file `swig<package>i`.

   This script also handles generic object renaming (e.g. stripping `XLAL`
   prefices from functions). See `swig_function_prefixes` in the
   `/swig/Makefile.am` for each package for the list of prefixes that are
   stripped, and `generate_swig_iface.py` for the variable and constant
   renames.

4. The SWIG C library files for each high-level binding are generated by
   running `swig -{octave,python} swig<package>.i`.

   The following files modify the build for each subpackage:

   - `/swig/SWIGCommon.i` (LAL only)
   - `/swig/SWIG<Package>Alpha.i` (always `%include`d first)
   - `/swig/SWIG<Package>Omega.i` (always `%include`d last)
   - `/swig/SWIGOctave.i`
   - `/swig/SWIGPython.i`

5. The C library for each binding is compiled.
