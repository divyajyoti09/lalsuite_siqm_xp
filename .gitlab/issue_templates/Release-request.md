#### Commit information

<!--
Please try and enumerate the commits you require to be included in the
new release. If you are unable to do this, you can select 'all commits',
but please note that this will take longer to complete.

In order to build atomic releases, it is ideal that the relevant
commits only impact the chosen subpackages. If this isn't the case,
the release will take longer to complete.

Please reference commits by the hash on the master branch.
-->

- [ ] all commits since the last release of this subpackage
- [ ] only these commits:
    - `hash1`
